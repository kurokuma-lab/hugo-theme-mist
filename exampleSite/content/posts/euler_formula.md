Euler's formula is a fundamental equation in complex analysis that establishes a deep relationship between trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. It is given by:

$$
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
$$

where:
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm,
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit, and
- \( x \) is a real number.

This formula is remarkable because it connects the exponential function with the trigonometric functions cosine and sine.

| \( x \) | \( e^{ix} \) |
|------|--------|
| \( 0 \)   | \( 1 \) |
| \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) | \( i\) |
| \( \pi \) | \( -1 \) |
| \( \frac{3\pi}{2} \) | \( -i \) |
| \( 2\pi \) | \( 1 \) |


## Visualizing Euler's Formula

To better understand Euler's formula, we can visualize it using Python. Below is a Python code snippet that plots Euler's formula on the complex plane.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Values of x from 0 to 2*pi
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000)

# Euler's formula
y = np.exp(1j * x)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.plot(np.real(y), np.imag(y), label=r'$e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$')
plt.xlabel('Real Part')
plt.ylabel('Imaginary Part')
plt.title('Visualization of Euler\'s Formula')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.show()
```

This code generates a plot of Euler's formula on the complex plane, showing how the exponential function traces out a circle.
