*Mist* is a Hugo theme that I built while planning to create my personal blog. I have always been a fan of minimalist theme [astro-theme-typography](https://github.com/moeyua/astro-theme-typography), and I wanted to customize some existing Hugo themes to fit my taste. As I made more and more changes, the theme evolved significantly and became quite different from the original themes I started with. This journey led to the creation of *Mist*, a simple and elegant theme designed to provide a clean and modern blogging experience.
